In this example, we have built a simple Spring Cloud application with 2 microservices and put a API gateway infront of it and built a small React application talking to talk to this microservices.

This example is built on top of a Udemy course [React + Spring Boot Microservices and Spring Cloud](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-spring-boot-microservices-and-spring-cloud/). And has simplified further with in memory H2 database. 

### Highlevel architecture is as below:
